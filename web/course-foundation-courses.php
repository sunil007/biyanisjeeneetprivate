			<p>Biyani&rsquo;s JEE NEET Private plans to get our students ready for their School/Board and just as cutthroat tests of public and worldwide notoriety like NTSE, NSTSE, JSTSE, NSO, IMO, iOS, iOM, and so on.</p>
			<p style='height:10px;'>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Other than planning for the aforementioned tests, the drawn out proverb is to establish a sound framework of candidates ahead of time as the batch name &lsquo;Agrim&rsquo; itself means, at a beginning phase to guarantee terrific achievement in the top&#39; Medical and Engineering Entrance Tests&#39; of the country.</p>
			<p style='height:10px;'>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The Foundation courses are comprehensive and carefully planned as these establish solid framework to understudies seeking to show up for CA-CPT tests after their XII boards. Justifiably, the projects of this unit assist with honing the abilities of normal candidates by giving them an early advantage to cause them pass with flying colours over the long haul. Believably, Foundations&#39; projects fill in as an impetus in turning normal and crude ability to stand apart as treasured ones.</p>
			<p style='height:10px;'>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Alongside planning of Engineering and Medical Entrance Exams, Biyani&rsquo;s JEE NEET Private gets students ready for KVPY and NSE (P/C/B/A) at class XI and XII level.</p>
