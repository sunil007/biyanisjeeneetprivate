			<h1>Olympiad Exams</h1>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p>The Mathematical Olympiad Programme in India, which leads to participation of Indian students in the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) is organized by the Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education (HBCSE) on behalf of the National Board for Higher Mathematics (NBHM) of the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), Government of India. This programme is one of the major initiatives undertaken by the NBHM. Its main purpose is to spot mathematical talent among pre-university students in the country.<br />
			For the purpose of training and selection of students for the Olympiad contest, 25 regions all over the country have been designated and each assigned a Regional Coordinator (RC). Additionally, three groups (Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS) and Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathana (KVS) have a &lsquo;Regional Coordinator&rsquo; each. The Mathematical Olympiad programme consists of six stages.</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<li>Conducted by Regional Coordinators under the guidance of HBCSE.</li>
				<li>For EGMO participation up to five girls would be additionally selected apart from the regional quota of 30 students &ndash; independent of the number of girls who may be part of the general quota of 30 students.</li>
				<li>Results of all the RMOs are declared centrally by the HBCSE.</li>
				<li>Eligibility: Students who qualify PRMO</li>
			</ul>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p><strong>Stage 3: Indian National Mathematical Olympiad (INMO)</strong></p>

			</ul>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong></p>

			<p>Pre-degree college mathematics - arithmetic of integers, geometry, quadratic equations and expressions, trigonometry, co-ordinate geometry, system of linear equations, permutations and combination, factorization of polynomial, inequalities, elementary combinatory, probability theory and number theory, finite series and complex numbers and elementary graph theory The syllabus does not include calculus and statistics. The major areas from which problems are given are algebra, combinatory, geometry and number theory. The syllabus is in a sense spread over Class XI to Class XII levels, but the problems under each topic involve high level of difficulty and sophistication. The difficulty level increases from RMO to INMO to IMO. Previous years Question papers available on the HBCSE website can provide a good idea of the types of question one can expect.</p>
			
			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p><strong>INMO Scholarship:</strong></p>

			<p>The INMO awardees who successfully complete IMOTC and who pursue B.Sc., or other courses as per the guidelines of the Board with mathematics as one of the principal subjects of study, are eligible to receive a scholarship of National Board of Higher Mathematics, which is at present Rs. 4,000 per month through the period of their undergraduate studies (subject to satisfactory progress). Enhance scholarship would be available for pursuing masters studies in Mathematics.</p>
			
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<h2>Science and Astronomy Olympiad Programs in India:</h2>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			
			<p>HBCSE, which is the nodal agency for the Science Olympiad Program in the country conducts the program in close collaboration with Indian Association of Physics Teachers (IAPT), Association of Chemistry Teachers (ACT), and the Association of Teachers in Biological Sciences (ATBS). The first stage of the Olympiad examinations is conducted by IAPT, while the later stages are the responsibility of HBCSE.</p>

			<p>The Science Olympiad program also follows 5 stages which are:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Stage I:&nbsp;</strong>National Standard Examinations (NSE)</li>
				<li><strong>Stage II:&nbsp;</strong>Indian National Olympiad (INO)</li>
				<li><strong>Stage III:&nbsp;</strong>Orientation cum Selection Camp (OCSC)</li>
				<li><strong>Stage IV:&nbsp;</strong>Pre-departure Training Camp (PDT)</li>
				<li><strong>Stage V:&nbsp;</strong>Participation in International Olympiad (IO)</li>
			</ul>

A student can participate in APMO being in his/her own country. India has been participating in the APMO since 2015. The APMO is a one day event consisting of solving 5 problems in four and a half hours. The other rules and regulations for participating in APMO are much like the IMO.</p>

			<p>11. European Girls&rsquo; Mathematical Olympiad (EGMO):&nbsp;It is an international Mathematics Competition.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.egmo.org/" target="_blank">https://www.egmo.org/</a></p>

			<p>The EGMO, which started in 2012, is a platform which seeks to promote a career in Mathematics amongst girl students by challenging the brightest four pre university girl students from each participating country. The EGMO is a two day event with two written tests held on two consecutive days. Each test consists of three problems and the contest lasts for four and half hours on each day. India has been participating in the EGMO since 2015 and the selection process for EGMO is conjoined with that for the IMO (The International Mathematical Olympiad) which will be discussed later in this handbook.</p>
